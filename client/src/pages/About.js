            Our mission is to bridge the communication gap between the deaf and
            the hearing community using advanced AI-powered technology. We
            believe in inclusivity, accessibility, and empowerment for all
            individuals. Through real-time sign language translation, we
            provide an intuitive and user-friendly platform that helps break
            down barriers and fosters seamless communication.

            <h3>üì∑Computer Vision</h3>
            <p>Our platform leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models to analyze and interpret hand gestures accurately. Using advanced techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Pose Estimation models, we track hand movements and facial expressions in real time. This ensures:
High-precision gesture recognition, even in varying lighting conditions.
Real-time tracking for faster and more accurate translations.
Adaptability to different signing styles and regional variations of ISL</p>

            <h3>üó£Ô∏èNatural Language Processing</h3>
            <p>Once gestures are recognized, they are converted into meaningful text and speech using powerful NLP algorithms. Our system:Understands context and intent to improve translation accuracy.
Generates grammatically correct sentences rather than direct word-for-word translations.
Supports multiple languages, enabling communication across different linguistic backgrounds..</p>
